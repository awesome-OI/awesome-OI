## Learning Resources
### Books
#### General
- [Competitive Programming, 2nd Edition](https://cpbook.net) Covers a collection of skills involved in ICPCs and IOIs.
- [Advanced Guide of Algorithm Contest](https://book.douban.com/subject/30136932/)
- [The Art of Algorithms and Olympics in Informatics](https://book.douban.com/subject/1154204/) A classic book for learning competitive programming. Outdated somehow.

#### Algorithm
